It has been more than a year since the start of this awful pandemic, and here we are. The hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 was possibly bioengineered and was accidentally (by some accounts, deliberately) leaked from some lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has leaped from its original host — Trump administration officials and people dismissed as conspiracy theorists — into the body of mainstream debate. In an exhaustive account of the viral possibilities [published this week](https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/) by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Nicholas Wade argues that the Chinese lab is the most likely source of the world-wide agony. Last week, Science Magazine published a letter signed by 18 scientists [calling for investigation for the origin of COVID-19](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/694.1) and demanding that Chinese labs and public health agencies open their records to outside scrutiny.

I had been skeptical of the "lab leak" theory because animal spillover is such an obvious answer. Historically, many lethal diseases that mankind has faced jumped from animals: bubonic plague from rodents, measles probably from cows, whooping cough maybe from dogs, and so on. Also, the leak idea was just *too* conveniently conspiratorial. But the "lab leak" hypothesis has been growing silently behind my back, mostly fueled by the lack of any conclusive evidence from the proponents of "natural origin" hypothesis.

Recently, science writer Nicholas Wade published an [article in Medium](https://nicholaswade.medium.com/origin-of-covid-following-the-clues-6f03564c038) pushing the idea that the Chinese lab is the most likely source of the world-wide agony, not the wet markets. 



My first reaction was dismissive. Nicholas Wade is a former New York Times writer, who once authored a book on race and genetics ([A Troublesome Inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Troublesome_Inheritance)) that was [openly denounced by 143 scientists](https://cehg.stanford.edu/letter-from-population-geneticists), including ones who said he misrepresented their research. But, past history has nothing to do with the merit (or demerit) of his current opinion piece. The details and circumstantial evidence were mostly sub

All we have so far is speculation, and all the explanations are unsatisfactory. 

Nicholas Wade questions the conflict of interest of Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance of New York, which funded coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But, past history has nothing to do with the merit (or demerit) of his current opinion piece. Thanks to his article, the 





1. There are two central claims about why SARS-CoV-2 could involve gain-of-function research:

   > But newer methods, called "no-see-um" or "seamless" approaches, leave no defining marks. Nor do other methods for manipulating viruses such as serial passage, the repeated transfer of viruses from one culture of cells to another. If a virus has been manipulated, whether with a seamless method or by serial passage, there is no way of knowing that this is the case.

The first claim is unsupported and the second claim is objectively wrong. Multiple studies have shown that SARS virus mutates in predictable ways in cell culture, and the same was found for SARS-CoV-2 [[Liu et. al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32571797/), [Lamers et. al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33835028/), [Pohl et. al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33760807/)]. Additional fun fact: These changes include genetic deletions that make the virus less likely to infect humans [[Lau et. al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32301390/)]. 

There are some inconclusive studies which point to SARS-CoV-2 being naturally derived after adaptation to an immune system. 

2. The second claim involves the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is too unique to be natural (aka, furin cleavage site, FCS and CGG codon).

   > Because of all known SARS-related beta-coronaviruses, only SARS2 possesses a furin cleavage site. All the other viruses have their S2 unit cleaved at a different site and by a different mechanism.

   On the contrary, FCSs are abundant, including being highly prevalent in coronaviruses. While SARS-CoV-2 is the first example of a SARSr virus with an FCS, other beta-coronaviruses (the genus for SARS-CoV-2) have FCSs, including MERS and HKU1 [[Wu et. al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scr.2020.102115)]. There is nothing mysterious about having a "first example". Viruses sampled to date is an inconsequential fraction of all the viruses circulating in the wild. Fragments, such as the CT-CCT-CGG-CGG-GC come and go all the time [[Goldstein et. al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33564759/)]. Here is a counter example (note, examples do not prove any hypothesis although Wade seem to have forgot about this logic) of a feline coronavirus with unique FCS while being absent in all related species:![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/7JkTOmd.jpg)

   

   On the CGG codon:

   > But CGG is coronavirus’s least popular codon for arginine. Keep that in mind when looking at how the amino acids in the furin cleavage site are encoded in the SARS2 genome.

   The genome prefers "stability" over "popularity". First, feline coronavirus also uses `CGG-CGA`, one nucleotide difference! Second, `CGG-CGG` is the most stable local configuration in that position. If they were not stable, we would see SARS-CoV-2 evolve away from `CGG` during the ongoing pandemic. `CGG` is 99.87% conserved in the first codon and 99.84% conserved in the second.  This is a strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 prefers `CGG` in these positions, but it does not explain how did it came there in the first place. Does it prove a natural origin? No, but it proves that it **can** be natural and invalidates Wade's comment: `A long chain with several improbable steps is unlikely to ever be completed.` Does it disprove a lab leak? No. But it disproves there being a "smoking gun" in the FCS. In fact, Wade's argument is just a rehash of the old creationist "if evolution is real how are there eyes" argument. Literally, the "created in a lab" people are arguing for creationism. Anecdote: Wade also fell into the trap of circular logic, when he wrote earlier in his article (in a different context): `Natural selection has done all the heavy lifting.` 

   Anecdote on the lab leak:

   > For the lab escape scenario, the double CGG codon is no surprise. The human-preferred codon is routinely used in labs. So anyone who wanted to insert a furin cleavage site into the virus’s genome would synthesize the PRRA-making sequence in the lab and would be likely to use CGG codons to do so.

   This is also unlikely. It is neither "routinely used in labs" nor "would be likely to use CGG codons to do so". The FCS itself, (P)RRAR, is not an optimal site (for cleavage) and unstable. Scientists use more optimal sites for CoV experiments [[Follis et. al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2006.02.003)]
